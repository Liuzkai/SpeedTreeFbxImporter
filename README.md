# SpeedTree Fbx Importer
This tool imports assets generated from SpeedTree into Houdini. Imported assets will be contained within subnets along with Redshift materials and material assignments.

## General Info
The importer will import subnets with this structure into the Houdini scene:
```
/obj                        # obj context
├── AppleTree               # Subnet Generated by SpeedTreeFbxImporter
│   ├── AppleTree_1         # Geometry
│   ├── AppleTree_2         # Geometry
│   ├── AppleTree_3         # Geometry
│   └── AppleTree_matnet    # Material Network
```
## Requirements
* Houdini 19.0 or above
* Redshift in Houdini
* Some setup (see Setup)
## Exporting From SpeedTree
> Export SpeedTree generated models using the Export Mesh tool in SpeedTree. Ensure that *Group By* is set to *Hierachy* and hit *OK*.  
> ***Do not import using the model using the Export Game tool.***

## Setup
### Folder Setup
> To run this project, each set of SpeedTree assets must live in the same directory:
```
AppleTree                     # Example of AppleTree Folder
├── AppleTree_var1.fbx        # fbx file
├── AppleTree_var1.fbx        # fbx file
├── AppleTree_var1.fbx        # fbx file
├── Bark.png                  # fbx file
└── Leaf.png                  # Textures
```
> Example of a folder structure. Folders may contain any number of subdirectories:
```
FolderWithAllMyTrees          # Folder
├── FruitTrees                # Folder
│   │   Berries               # Folder
│   │   └── Strawberry        # Folder with SpeedTree assets
|   |
│   ├── AppleTree             # Folder with SpeedTree assets
│   ├── BananaPlant           # Folder with SpeedTree assets
│   └── CherryTree            # Folder with SpeedTree assets
| 
├── AfricanTrees              # Folder
│   ├── Acacia                # Folder with SpeedTree assets
│   └── Baobab                # Folder with SpeedTree assets
|
├── Oak                       # Folder with SpeedTree assets
└── MapleTree                 # Folder with SpeedTree assets
```
### Script Location
> Add SpeedTreeAssetGenerator folder $HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR/python3.7libs . See [python locations](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/locations.html) for docs on Python script locations.  
> For Gnomon, place SpeedTreeAssetGenerator folder in Z:/houdini19.0/python3.7libs . Create the folder if it does not exist.  
> 
> Add SpeedTreeFbxImporterByDaniel.pypanel to python_panels directory. See [python panel](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/windows/pythonpaneleditor.html) for docs on Python Panel Editor.  
> For Gnomon, place SpeedTreeFbxImporterByDaniel.pypanel in Z:/houdini19.0/python_panels . Create the folder if it does not exist.  
### Houdini Setup
> This tool is accessed through a dockable Python Panel in a Houdini session.

1. Add a python panel.

2. Select SpeedTree Fbx Importer by Daniel in the drop down menu. If the selection is missing, restart Houdini.

## Notes
SpeedTree fbxs automatically assigns primitive groups according to material.  
*Do not change name of the group nodes and group names. Do not change the name of texture files. If materials are not rendering, consider reimporting.*  
*After running the Importer in Houdini, if the number of geos do not match the number of FBXs on disk. You may have exported SpeedTree generated models using the Export Game tool. Re-export using Export Mesh tool and reimport in Houdini.*
## Task List
- [ ] Make compatible with assets other than fbx
- [ ] Make compatible with versions before Houdini 19.0
- [ ] Support textures other than png
