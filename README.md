### Folder Setup
> To run this project, each set of SpeedTree assets must live in the same directory:
```
AppleTree                     # Example of AppleTree Folder
├── AppleTree_var1.fbx        # fbx file
├── AppleTree_var1.fbx        # fbx file
├── AppleTree_var1.fbx        # fbx file
├── Bark.png                  # fbx file
└── Leaf.png                  # Textures
```
Example of a folder structure. Folders may contain any number of subdirectories:
